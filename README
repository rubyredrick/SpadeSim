A montecarlo simulator to find approximate probabilities of any club winning the opening trick of a four player game of spades, using the rule variation requiring that the player's lowest club must be played in the first hand.

sim.rb is a command line ruby program to run the simulator.

It takes one optional integer argument which is the number of hand to simulate.

If the argument is not an integer, then the program will output some help text and exit.

If no argument is given then the simulation will run until each club has one at least one hand, but this will take a long time since the 2 of clubs will only win if one player is dealt all of the clubs, and the probability of this is very small on the order of 1 in 150 billion.
